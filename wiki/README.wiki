Normal use should look something like this:
  # Start
  # Open ME2 save
  # Open ME3 save (should be the same character of ME2)
  # Edit mapping (skippable)
  # Save modified ME3 save (will be saved on same folder as in 2. as "Save_1000.pcsav")
  # Repeat 4 and 5 as needed
  # Exit

Mapping is stored on the executable directory as "lod_mapping.xml".
To start with a fresh map, simply delete the file and restart editor.
